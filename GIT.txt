<!-- git auto completion ------------------------------------ -->
git auto completion

These are the steps that need to be done to install the ness code to add the auto completion files

cd ~      go to the user dir

Download the files 
curl -OL https://github.com/git/git/raw/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash 

move the file to the right folder
 mv ~/git-completion.bash ~/.git-completion.bash 
 
go to the bash profile 
nano .bash_profile

load the bash files 
if [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then 
        source ~/.git-completion.bash
fi

<!-- git config ------------------------------------------- -->
git config

The first thing that you want to add a user name so that GIT will know who you are when working on a team this is important step

System 
git config --system

User 
git config --global                                 Tells GIT to go to the Global settings
git config --global user.name "Thomas D Keven"              Sets the global user name
git config --global user.email "thomasdkleven@gmail.com"   Sets the global email
git config --list                            Shows all the configuration settings 

cd ~            This takes you to your home directory
ls -la            This lists your files that you set up    

Project 
git config 

git config --global core.editor "Sublime Text2.app -w"       This configs what text editor you are using
git config --global color.ui true   This sets it so that GIT colors the output of the code

cat .gitconfig    This gives you your settings for the GIT program

<!—basics of the remote repository ----------------------------------------------- --> 
push: Pushing Changes to the Server
fetch: Fetching the changes from the Server
merge: Merge the two together
 


<!-- git init ----------------------------------------------- --> 
git init

in this tut we cover how to set up the git project

go to the home directory
cd ~

home dir/Desktop/first-git-project
cd Desktop/first-git-project

initialize git on this folder 
git init

checks the folder 
ls 

shows all of the files in the folder and hidden files
ls -la 

this shows all of the helper files that git uses to track your changes
DONT CHANGE THIS ONLY CHANGE THE RB CONFIG FILE
ls -la .git 



<!-- git add --------------------------------------------------- -->
git add index.hm    this will stage only the files specified into the staging area
git add .   use this method if there are more than one file to commit



<!-- git commit --------------------------------------------------- -->
git commit -m "initialize the changes that I made"
in this tut we cover how to commit your changes 

the . will tell git to commit all changes in the folder that you are in 
MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT FOLDER 
git add .

this will tell git to commit all changes to the memory 
git commit -m "initialize the changes that I made"


Notes:
when making messages make sure that you use less than 50 char 

optionally you ca follow up with a blank line that a more complete description 

We can use a text editor to make these messages but only limit to 75 char

never use past tense when making messages 
fix bug or fixes bug but not fixed bug

bullet points are usually asterisks or hyphens 

can add "ticket tracking numbers" from bugs or support requests

suggestions
can develop shorthand for your organization 
"[css,js]"   was messing with the css and js
"bugfix:" I fixed a bug  
"#38405"    what support ticket that we fixed



<!-- viewing diff ------------------------------------ -->
git diff 

When you want to check what changes that were made to your files from one commit to another you can use the git diff command



<!-- viewing commit logs ------------------------------------ -->
git log

in this tut there are tips and theory on how to use comments 

git log
show me the log information 

q to quit the log



<!-- git rm  Removing files ------------------------------------ -->
git rm delete.htm 
git status
git commit -m “Deleted the delete.htm file”



<!-- git mv Moving and renaming files --------------------------------  -->
Changing the name:
git mv Desktop/my_file.htm Desktop/my_files.htm

Moving the file:
git mv Desktop/my_file.htm  Desktop/htm/my_file.htm 

git mv will find the file that you listed to be renamed then replace that file with the name of the second file indicated you have to add the file location for GIT to understand where the file is located.

== VERY IMPORTANT —-
git add --all  this command will find the changes that you made manually and update the repository to reflect any manual deletions of files in the system you must use this command or GIT will still try to find and track the deleted files



<!-- git checkout --------------------------------  -->
git checkout —- index.htm

to target and change the working directory that you want to replace the file in use the —- symbol before the name of the file

the above code says to find the copy of the index.hm file and replace my version with the one that I have saved in the directory 



<!-- git checkout (reverting to a previous state )  --------------------------------  -->
git checkout f319ba89430baf —- index.htm
git status 	   checks what files are staged
git diff —staged   shows the difference between versions
git commit -m “f319ba89430baf reverted to previous state”

or to forget the change 

git reset HEAD index.htm 
git checkout —- index.htm
git status     now your directory should be clean

really screwed up need to revert the file to the old state 
1. checkout the file that you want  copy (SHA)code from the log

2. checkout the SHA logged version the use double dash and the name of the file that you want to replace with that checked out file

3. BEST PRACTICE IS TO refer to the SHA in your commits so that others can see what you were trying to do.



<!-- git revert (reverting to a previous state )  --------------------------------  -->
git log      find the SHA code that you want to revert to 
git revert f319ba89430baf   after running 
git status   should be clean
git log      this will show you 



<!-- git reset HEAD file_name Un staging files --------------------------------  -->
git reset HEAD index.hm

if you have staged a file then realize that you need to unstage it to work on some more changes before committing the file then use the command above



<!-- Branching --------------------------------  -->
git branch    will check how many branches you have
git branch navigation_idea  this will add a branch



<!-- Switching to a new branch --------------------------------  -->
git checkout navigation_idea  switches to the branch we created and changes in editor
git checkout master  switches back to the master branch and changes to the branch in editor

git log —-oneline will show you just changes on the one branch



<!-- comparing branches --------------------------------  -->
git diff master..navigation_idea

1.git diff checks out the changes between the two files targeted
2. remember to put the two .. between the two files  



<!-- renaming branches --------------------------------  -->
git branch -m navigation_idea footer_idea
git branch   this will check the names of all branches

1. run the git branch and list the file name that you want to change 
2. add a space between the old name and the new name that you want to switch too



<!-- deleting branches --------------------------------  -->
git branch -d name_of_file  this will delete the file that you list 
or
git branch —delete name_of_file  this will delete the file that you list 
git branch  this will show all of the branches

1. You can’t delete the branch that you are on you have to be on a different one
2. If you make changes but did not merge the change then when you run the delete command it will notify you that you did not merge changes

git branch -D name_of_file   this will delete the file that you that merges have not been completed 



<!-- Merging branch --------------------------------  -->
git checkout master         this is the file that we want the change to effect
git merge navigation_idea   this file now will be merged with the master

1. from the branch that you want to receive the change merge the change file into that branch

2. git merge name_of_file     command this will merge the two branches

3. git branch —merged         This will tell you what two files merged together 




<!-- git help ---------------------------------------- -->
git —-help

git --version      tells the version of git 
git --help        brings ip the help files

The most commonly used git commands are:
   add        Add file contents to the index
   bisect     Find by binary search the change that introduced a bug
   branch     List, create, or delete branches
   checkout   Checkout a branch or paths to the working tree
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   diff       Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   fetch      Download objects and refs from another repository
   grep       Print lines matching a pattern
   init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
   log        Show commit logs
   merge      Join two or more development histories together
   mv         Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push       Update remote refs along with associated objects
   rebase     Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head
   reset      Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   rm         Remove files from the working tree and from the index
   show       Show various types of objects
   status     Show the working tree status
   tag        Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG
   
  
  the git help command will give you info about the command they are help files that tell you how the commands work
  git help add
